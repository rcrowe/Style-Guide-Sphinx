Commenting
##########

Well commented code is extremely important. Take time to describe components, how they work, their limitations, and the way they are constructed. Don't leave others in the team guessing as to the purpose of uncommon or non-obvious code.

Comments in CSS files should follow these patters:

- Place comments on a new line above the selector.
- Avoid end of line comments
- Keep line-length to a sensible maximum, e.g., 80 columns.
- Make liberal use of comments to break CSS code into discrete sections.
- Use consistent text indentation

**Example**: ::

    /* ===================================================================
       Section comment block
       =================================================================== */

    /* Sub-section comment block
       =================================================================== */

    /**
     * Short description goes here.
     *
     * Long description can go here. These can
     * even go onto multiple lines.
     */

    /* Basic comment */
