PHP-FIG
#######

If the PHP style guide does not cover a topic or item then look to the `PHP-FIG <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards>`_
for how they do it.

`PHP-FIG <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards>`_ is the PHP Framework Interop Group. They are helping to shape the standards
for PHP code to make it more compatible and readable. In most cases we try to follow their standards as closely as possible.

Currently *(as of 03/07/12)* they have the following standards:

- `PSR-0 <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md/>`_ - Namespacing & autoloading
- `PSR-1 <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md/>`_ - Basic coding standard
- `PSR-2 <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md/>`_ - Optional coding standards
